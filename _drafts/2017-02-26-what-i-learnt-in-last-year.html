In the past 10 months I have been working as a Application Penetration Tester with a focus on testing, auditing and helping fix web applications. I have audited a wide range of applications made using an array of different technologies. In order to be able to read the code of these applications I had to pick up new languages, get well acquainted with the program idioms of each technology and know the technology stack from top to bottom. This is tough work.<br /><div><br /></div><div>My experience with code auditing from the past three years as a pentester doing network and application security was limited. Most of the security testing I did was blackbox and only on occasional engagements we had source code to review.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>There's no doubt that having the source code enables a security tester to find a lot more bugs. But, it also requires the tester to be well versed in a lot of different technologies.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>List of languages that applications I have audited in the past year have been written in:</div><div><ul><li>Perl&nbsp;</li><li>Java</li><li>Ruby</li><li>Python</li><li>Javascript</li><li>Go</li><li>Bash</li></ul><div><br /></div></div><div>Of these 7 languages I knew Java, Python, Javascript and Bash already. However, web applications can be written in a range of different ways. A Perl CGI script is different from a full-fledged MVC Perl application. A NodeJS application is very different from being able to read Javascript executed in the browser on a random website.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The stack that accompanies these languages encourages (or enforces) some structure to the code. Or (as in Rails) does lots of magic behind the scenes that is just implicitly known to those familiar with the framework. So once you have audited a NodeJS application, auditing the next will most likely be easier.<br /><br /><h4>Depth</h4>Still there's only so much in-depth one can learn about a language in a short period of time. All of these languages have quirks that are<br /><br /><br /><br /><h4>Books</h4><div>The way I like to learn a new language is to start reading some code and accompany it with reading the quickstart guides or tutorials. But to get a more wholistic overview of the language it is always good to pick up a book about it. Here are some of the books I've been reading while learning these languages:</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>For Perl I've been reading "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Perl-Making-Things-Possible/dp/1491954329/" target="_blank">Learning Perl</a>"&nbsp;</li><li>For NodeJS I've been reading "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Node-js-Building-Javascript-Scalable/dp/1118185463/" target="_blank">Professional Node.JS</a>"</li><li>Go Go I've been reading "<a href="http://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/" target="_blank">The Little Go Book</a>"</li><li>For Ruby on Rails I've been reading "<a href="http://www.humblelittlerubybook.com/" target="_blank">The Humble Little Ruby Book</a>" and the "<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Rails Guides</a>"&nbsp;</li></ul><div>These are nice supplements to the documentation pages for the language or framework.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><h4>Accompanying databases, load-balancers and test frameworks</h4><div><br /></div><br /></div>
