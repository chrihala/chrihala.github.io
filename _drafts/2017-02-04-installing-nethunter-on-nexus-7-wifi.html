To install Nethunter on the Nexus 7 (Wifi 2013) edition we first need to unlock the bootloader of the device and root it. There are many guides on the Internet on how to do this. I followed an excellent Youtube instruction video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65qy0SAcndc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65qy0SAcndc</a>) which made use of the Nexus Root Toolkit v2.1.9 and a Windows 10 virtual machine installed in OSX on VMWare fusion.   The video suggests downloading the Nexus Root Toolkit from <a href="http://www.wugfresh.com/nrt">here</a>. This site is a little shady, so doing this in a virtual machine may not be a bad idea.  The Nexus Root Toolkit has great instructions built into the program itself. It may need to get some updates after downloading though and automatic update of those failed for me so I had to download from the provided link and import the downloaded zip file.  The next step is to go through "initial setup" which is a set of steps detailed in the application, to uninstall some android device drivers, make sure developer mode is enabled and that MTP storage is possible. Finally the program installs a device driver for the device.  After this is all done, we are ready to unlock the bootloader. This takes the device into Fastboot and unlocks the bootloader so that we can flash other ROMs to the device. This is a prerequisite before we can root the device.  This process requires that the device reboots and I had problems with VMWare not detecting the device after booting into Fastboot or back to normal. By physically plugging the cable out and back in again VMWare was able to detect the device and fortunately the software was very tolerant to this by retrying the connection if the device could not be found.  After unlocking the bootloader it is time for rooting the device. The process is very similar and as the former step and once we get VMWare to detect the device this step is piece of cake. The device reboots a few times and we are done. We need to setup the device with a Google account to get access to the Play Store for our next step, downloading the TWRP Manager (or download the APK via other means and have it ready).  We verify that we are root by running the SuperSU app and also install Busybox using the installer already on our menu from the root team :)  Now we need a Nethunter image from here: <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/">https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/</a> I also made sure to make a NAND backup at this stage using the Nexux Root Toolkit's Backup functionality. I selected all the top checkboxes for backing up everything and went through the steps of booting into the bootloader, loading the TWRP image and running the backup. It then stores a backup to your computer which we can recover from if we should screw up the device. This step takes quite a while so if you are in a rush you should probably skip this for now.  But forget about backups, let's install Kali Linux Nethunter. I downloaded the Nexus 7 2013 Marshmallow image (Android 6.0) and moved it onto my device by using Windows Explorer. Placing it at the root of the filesystem is fine.  The video then says to use to the TWRP Manager application to install from the zip. That did not work for me so I ended up just using the Nexus Root Toolkit's functionality instead. This actually led me into some trouble because I did not wipe the device before installing and the device ends up in a boot loop.
