Due to shoddy WiFi in my office I had to setup my computer with another adapter to try to get some better signal.<br /><br />If you are on Windows 10, going to "Device management" and clicking "Update driver" is all it takes to get the drivers for this adapter.<br /><br />Just like this blog post from Alfa Networks says:<br />http://alfanetworkinc.blogspot.dk/2015/08/blog-post.html<br /><br />
